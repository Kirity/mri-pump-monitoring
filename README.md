# Project Overview
This project is being developed to monitor the parameters of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Pump, which is used as 
cooling system to MRI machine. 
Cooling system is one of the critical systems of MRI, so it becomes necessary to monitor the functioning(i.e. parameters) of Pump.
Pressure, Temperature, Noise and Vibration of pump are the assessment parameters, and they are been measured periodically 
with the help of raspberry pi kits(Which has been already developed by client side, full explanation is out of context of this document).

• Our project aim is to send the relevant data(parameters), measured at each MRI Pump to a central storage location.

• Depending on data received and send out alerts to corresponding and responsible persons.

• Providing a functionality to pull the data from the selected MRI when required.

• Provide an interface to visualize and analyze the data.
